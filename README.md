## Description
This is a backend app with a server that can be used to keep track of products, categories, and tags. For each group of data there routes for GET requests for all, GET requests by id, POST requests to add items, PUT requests by id to change information, and DELETE requests by id to remove an item. 

This project helped me understand sequelize relationships and setting up objects.
